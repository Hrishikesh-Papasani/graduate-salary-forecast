## Overview
This data-driven project provides valuable insights and predictions regarding graduate salaries, benefiting both recent graduates and employers in a competitive job market.

## Problem Statement
Graduates often struggle to negotiate fair salaries for their first jobs, while employers find it challenging to determine compensation based on factors like education and experience. 
This project aims to develop predictive models and uncover essential insights to estimate engineering graduate salaries effectively.

## Objectives
- **Data Analysis**:
  - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between variables and graduate salaries.
  - Identify patterns and trends within the dataset.

- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Engineer relevant features impacting salary predictions.
  - Handle categorical variables, missing data, and create new features.

- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Train and evaluate a variety of regression models to predict engineering graduate salaries.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
  - Fine-tune models by optimizing hyperparameters for improved accuracy.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Assess model performance using metrics such as R2 score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

- **Interpretability**:
  - Provide insights into features with significant impacts on salary predictions, aiding graduates and employers in understanding salary determinants.
